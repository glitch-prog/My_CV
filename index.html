              I am a Front-End Developer. My age is 18 years. Since 2009 I'm
              learning English and now I have ะก1+ level, which was assigned me
              by the English courses named "Streamline". I've been studying in
              Minsk Radio Enginiring College since 2019 (now I'm studyingon the

              Before trying myself in Web, I had been studying C++, Game Dev.
              since 2015. But I've understood, that being a Front-End Developer
              I can bring more impact to this world. Also I am trying myself in
              Java, developing Mobile Apps.

              Talking about Front-End, I've been trying to be the part of
              SoftCorp. I've been working with React.js and Vanilla.js. And for
              this moment, I'm studing in TeachMeSkills' course 'Front-End
              Developer' to learn more about HTML,CSS,JS,React(React Native).
